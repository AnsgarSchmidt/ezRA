# ezColX.py_retired_so_use_ezCol.py
# Feb-7-2023


# ezCol221110a.py was the last single-process version.

# Then with Todd Ullery's help, the experimental ezColX230205c.py was developed
# to explore a program with 2 processes, to improve dashboard responsiveness.

# The experiment was a success.

# The last ezColX230205c.py is now named ezCol230206a.py,
# and the short-lived experimental name ezColX is retired.

# Stop looking for ezColX.
# Use the new ezCol.
