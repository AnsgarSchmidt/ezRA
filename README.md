# ezRA - Easy Radio Astronomy

The ezRA Easy Radio Astronomy set of programs are free PC tools to help folks beginning to explore Radio Astronomy, with 
1420 MHz Galactic hydrogen data collection and analysis.
The programs run on the Python3 programming language, on Windows and Linux.

The ezRA set of programs are still in development, but mostly work well.

=============================================

ezRA documentation has many images.
Rather than duplicate those image bytes here in an online README.md file,
please see these introductory PDFs from the ezRA directory:

* "Sales Brochure" showing what ezRA can do:<br>

=============================================

## There are 5 major ezRA programs:

	ezCol - COLlect radio signals into integrated frequency spectrum ezRA .txt data files.

		Or convert previous radio data with ezColBAA, ezColHay, ezColIFAvg,
		ezColSc, etc.

		ezFix - remove unwanted samples from, combine, edit, and split frequency spectrum
		ezRA .txt data files.

	ezCon - CONdense one or more frequency spectrum data .txt files into
		one .ezb text data file, and perhaps one Galaxy crossing spectra *Gal.npz data file.

	ezPlot - PLOT analysis from one or more .ezb condensed data files.

	ezSky - SKY maps from one or more .ezb condensed data files.

	ezGal - GALaxy plots from one or more spectra *Gal.npz data files (Galaxy rotation,
		Velocity vs Galactic Longitude, Galaxy arm plots?).

Interested folks on GitHub would left-click on the top right Green button and probably choose "Download ZIP" (currently 25 MB).

## Status:

These files need lots of cleanup, but should work or be helpful:

    ezColBAA.py
    ezColHay.py
    ezColIFAvg.py
    ezColSc.py

    ezFix.py

Need to research multiple processes for ezCol.py, to improve dashboard responsiveness.

Always need more documentation, starting with installation.

Comments are encouraged !

Help improve ezRA.
